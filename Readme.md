# Using Jupyter Notebook with Bokhylla as corpus
**January 10th 2019, 09:00-16:00, Niels Henrik Abels hus, room UE32**


This workshop is about how to access and use the corpus of texts known as Bokhylla for 
humanities research, like comparing texts, classify texts (e.g. author attribution), collocations and sentiment analysis among others.

## Subjects covered
Participants will learn how to build their own corpus from the collection using libray metadata, and then go on to study the corpus using commands developed at the library for this purpose. 

Notebooks can be tested in the browser, without installing any Python, by following this link to [myBinder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Yoonsen/Bazaar/master). It will also work on mobile phones.
